# Component Review

Review React component design for structure, props, state management, and best practices.

---

## Context

Before reviewing, gather:
- The component file(s) to review
- Related type definitions or interfaces
- Parent components that consume this component
- Custom hooks used by the component
- Project's ESLint/TypeScript configuration for React rules

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Component Structure**
   - Review file organization (imports, types, component, exports)
   - Check component size - identify if it should be split
   - Verify single responsibility principle adherence
   - Assess naming conventions for clarity

2. **Check Prop Types and Interfaces**
   - Validate TypeScript interfaces/types for all props
   - Check for proper optional vs required prop definitions
   - Identify missing prop validation or overly permissive types
   - Review default prop values for appropriateness
   - Flag `any` types that should be specific

3. **Review State Management**
   - Assess local state necessity - could it be derived?
   - Check for state that should be lifted up
   - Identify state that could move to context or external store
   - Review useState initializers for expensive computations

4. **Evaluate Component Composition and Reusability**
   - Identify hardcoded values that should be props
   - Check for proper children/render prop patterns
   - Review component coupling - is it too tightly bound?
   - Identify opportunities for compound component patterns
   - Assess if component is too specific or too generic

5. **Identify Logic for Hook Extraction**
   - Identify logic clusters that form cohesive behavior
   - Flag useEffect + useState combinations for custom hooks
   - Look for reusable data fetching or subscription logic
   - Check for business logic mixed with presentation

6. **Validate Accessibility (a11y) Basics**
   - Check semantic HTML usage (button vs div, etc.)
   - Verify ARIA attributes where needed
   - Review keyboard navigation support
   - Check focus management in interactive elements
   - Validate form label associations
   - Verify color contrast and visual indicators

7. **Check Key Usage in Lists**
   - Verify stable, unique keys (not array indices for dynamic lists)
   - Review key prop placement (on outermost mapped element)
   - Check for missing keys in fragments

8. **Cross-Reference with React Best Practices**
   - Compare against React documentation patterns
   - Check for deprecated patterns (legacy context, findDOMNode, etc.)
   - Verify controlled vs uncontrolled component consistency
   - Review error boundary usage for error-prone sections
   - Check for proper event handler naming (onAction pattern)

### Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of component health]

### Structure Analysis
| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| File organization | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... |
| Component size | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... |
| Single responsibility | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... |
| Naming conventions | ✅/⚠️/❌ | ... |

### Props & Interfaces
| Prop | Type | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| [name] | [type] | [issue or "OK"] |

**Props Count**: X [OK/Warning: consider restructuring]

### State Management
- **Local State**: [List with assessment]
- **Derived State Candidates**: [State that could be computed]
- **Lift Candidates**: [State that should move up]

### Reusability Score: [Low/Medium/High]
- [Factors affecting reusability]
- [Specific improvements needed]

### Hook Extraction Candidates
1. **use[Name]** - [Logic to extract: state + effects]
2. **use[Name]** - [Logic to extract]

### Accessibility Issues
- [ ] [Issue]: [Fix suggestion]
- [ ] [Issue]: [Fix suggestion]

### Key Usage
- [OK/Issues found with specific locations]

### Recommended Changes
1. **Critical**: [Change]
2. **Important**: [Change]
3. **Nice to have**: [Change]

### Code Examples
[Before/after snippets for key recommendations]
```

## Interactive Decisions

Ask the user before proceeding when:
- Component split would require significant refactoring
- State management changes would affect parent components
- Accessibility fixes require design input (focus order, announcements)
- Hook extraction would create new shared dependencies
- Props refactoring would affect multiple consumers
- Breaking changes would require migration across the codebase
