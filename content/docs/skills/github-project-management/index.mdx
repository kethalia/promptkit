name: github-project-management
description: GitHub project management workflows using issues and the gh CLI. Use when planning features, breaking down work into epics and sub-issues, or organizing development tasks. Triggers include "create epic", "break down work", "GitHub issues", "plan feature", "create sub-issues", "gh issue", or when starting medium-to-large development efforts. ALWAYS create epic issues for non-trivial work with compact, digestible sub-issues.

# GitHub Project Management Skill

Manage development work through GitHub issues with proper hierarchy. This skill enforces:
1. **Epic Issues** - For medium-to-large workloads (REQUIRED)
2. **Sub-Issues** - Compact, digestible tasks linked to epics
3. **gh CLI** - Command-line issue management

## Critical Rule

> **ALWAYS create an Epic issue for any work that involves 2+ distinct tasks or will take more than a few hours. Break it into sub-issues immediately.**

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Reference |
|----------|-----------|
| Create epic with sub-issues | See [epic-issues.md](references/epic-issues.md) |
| Write good sub-issues | See [sub-issues.md](references/sub-issues.md) |
| gh CLI commands | See [gh-cli-commands.md](references/gh-cli-commands.md) |
| Planning workflow | See [workflow.md](references/workflow.md) |

## Issue Hierarchy

```
Epic Issue (#100)
├── Sub-issue (#101) - Compact task 1
├── Sub-issue (#102) - Compact task 2
├── Sub-issue (#103) - Compact task 3
└── Sub-issue (#104) - Compact task 4
```

## When to Create an Epic

| Work Size | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Small (< 2 hours, single task) | Regular issue |
| Medium (2-8 hours, 2-5 tasks) | **Epic + sub-issues** |
| Large (> 8 hours, 5+ tasks) | **Epic + sub-issues** (consider splitting epic) |

## Epic Issue Template

```markdown
## Overview
[1-2 sentences: What and why]

## Goals
- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2

## Sub-Issues
- [ ] #101 - [Task 1 title]
- [ ] #102 - [Task 2 title]
- [ ] #103 - [Task 3 title]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Notes
[Technical context, links, decisions]
```

## Sub-Issue Template

```markdown
## Task
[1-2 sentences: What to do]

## Details
- Detail 1
- Detail 2

## Done When
- [ ] Specific completion criterion

Parent: #100
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Create epic issue
gh issue create --title "Epic: Feature Name" --body "..." --label "epic"

# Create sub-issue linked to epic
gh issue create --title "Sub: Task Name" --body "Parent: #100"

# List issues
gh issue list --label "epic"

# View issue
gh issue view 100

# Close issue
gh issue close 101
```

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Identify work → Is it 2+ tasks? → Create Epic
2. Break down → List all distinct tasks
3. Create Epic → With overview and empty sub-issue checklist
4. Create Sub-issues → One per task, link to epic
5. Update Epic → Add sub-issue numbers to checklist
6. Work → Complete sub-issues, close as done
7. Close Epic → When all sub-issues complete
```

## Labels to Use

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `epic` | Marks epic issues |
| `sub-issue` | Marks sub-issues (optional) |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependency |
| `in-progress` | Currently being worked |

## Output Format

When creating issues, output:

```markdown
## Issues Created

### Epic: [Title]
- Issue: #[number]
- URL: [link]

### Sub-Issues
| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| #101 | Task 1 | Created |
| #102 | Task 2 | Created |

### Next Steps
1. [Immediate action]
```
