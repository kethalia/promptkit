# CI/CD Skill

Comprehensive CI/CD patterns with GitHub Actions. This skill covers:
1. **GitHub Actions** - Workflows, jobs, actions
2. **Testing Pipelines** - Automated test runs
3. **Deployment** - Staging, production, rollbacks
4. **Optimization** - Caching, parallelization

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Reference |
|----------|-----------|
| GitHub Actions workflows | See [github-actions.md](references/github-actions.md) |
| Testing pipelines | See [testing-pipelines.md](references/testing-pipelines.md) |
| Deployment strategies | See [deployment.md](references/deployment.md) |

## GitHub Actions Quick Reference

### Basic Workflow

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### Common Triggers

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  release:
    types: [published]
```

### Job Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

### Environment Variables & Secrets

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - run: ./deploy.sh
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

## Pipeline Stages

```
┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│  Lint   │ → │  Test   │ → │  Build  │ → │ Deploy  │
└─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
```

## Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Risk | Downtime | Rollback |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| Rolling | Low | None | Slow |
| Blue-Green | Low | None | Fast |
| Canary | Very Low | None | Fast |
| Recreate | High | Yes | Slow |

## Output Format

When creating CI/CD pipelines:

```markdown
## Pipeline: [Name]

### Trigger
[When pipeline runs]

### Stages
1. [Stage 1]
2. [Stage 2]

### Workflow
