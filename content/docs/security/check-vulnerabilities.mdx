# Check Vulnerabilities

Quick scan for common security vulnerabilities with actionable fixes.

---

## Context

Gather before starting:
- Target files or directories to scan
- Language and framework in use
- Whether this is new code or existing codebase
- Known areas of concern (if any)

## Instructions

1. **Scan for hardcoded secrets**
   - Search for API keys, tokens, passwords in code
   - Check for AWS keys, private keys, certificates
   - Look in configuration files, comments, test files
   - Patterns: `password=`, `api_key=`, `secret`, `token`, `Bearer`
   - Check for base64-encoded secrets

2. **Identify SQL/NoSQL injection points**
   - Find string concatenation in queries
   - Check for unsanitized user input in database operations
   - Review ORM usage for raw query vulnerabilities
   - Look for: `execute()`, `query()`, `find()`, `aggregate()` with user input

3. **Find XSS vulnerabilities**
   - Locate user input rendered in HTML without encoding
   - Check for `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `v-html`
   - Review template variables without auto-escaping
   - Find JavaScript evaluation of user data (`eval`, `Function()`)
   - Check URL parameters reflected in output

4. **Check for path traversal**
   - Find file operations using user-supplied paths
   - Look for: `../`, path concatenation, `readFile`, `writeFile`
   - Verify path normalization and validation
   - Check archive extraction for zip slip

5. **Identify command injection**
   - Find shell execution with user input
   - Look for: `exec`, `spawn`, `system`, `popen`, backticks
   - Check for proper argument escaping
   - Review subprocess calls

6. **Validate authentication checks**
   - Verify auth middleware on protected routes
   - Check for authentication bypass paths
   - Review session validation logic
   - Look for timing attacks in comparisons

7. **Verify authorization checks**
   - Ensure object-level authorization exists
   - Check for missing permission validations
   - Look for direct object references without access control
   - Review admin functionality access

8. **Check for insecure configurations**
   - Debug mode enabled in production
   - CORS allowing all origins
   - Missing security headers
   - Insecure cookie settings

## Interactive Decisions

Confirm with user:
- [ ] Which directories/files to prioritize
- [ ] Whether to scan test files
- [ ] If deprecated/legacy code should be included
- [ ] Whether to auto-fix simple issues
