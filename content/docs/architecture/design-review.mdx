# Design Review

Review system or component design for architectural quality and alignment with best practices.

---

## Context

Gather before analysis:
- Architecture documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/)
- Component structure and module organization
- Dependency graph (package.json, imports, go.mod, etc.)
- Existing design decisions or ADRs
- Stated architectural patterns (MVC, hexagonal, etc.)

## Instructions

1. **Map the architecture**
   - Identify layers, modules, and their responsibilities
   - Trace key data flows and control flows
   - Document external dependencies and integration points

2. **Evaluate SOLID principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Does each module have one reason to change?
   - Open/Closed: Can behavior be extended without modification?
   - Liskov Substitution: Are abstractions properly substitutable?
   - Interface Segregation: Are interfaces focused and minimal?
   - Dependency Inversion: Do high-level modules depend on abstractions?

3. **Check separation of concerns**
   - Business logic isolated from infrastructure?
   - UI/presentation separate from domain?
   - Data access abstracted appropriately?

4. **Identify coupling issues**
   - Find circular dependencies between modules
   - Flag tight coupling (concrete dependencies, shared mutable state)
   - Note inappropriate intimacy between components

5. **Verify architectural consistency**
   - Does implementation match documented architecture?
   - Are patterns applied consistently across codebase?
   - Identify drift from stated design

6. **Assess scalability and maintainability**
   - Bottlenecks for horizontal/vertical scaling
   - Areas requiring high effort to modify
   - Test isolation capabilities

7. **Cross-reference documentation**
   - Compare actual vs documented behavior
   - Flag outdated or missing documentation

| Issue | Location | Impact | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| ...   | ...      | ...    | ...            |

#### Moderate
| Issue | Location | Impact | Recommendation |

### SOLID Compliance
| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SRP       | ✓/✗/~  | ...   |
| OCP       | ✓/✗/~  | ...   |

### Proposed Improvements
1. [Improvement]: [Tradeoff analysis - effort vs benefit]
2. ...

### Documentation Gaps
- [Missing or outdated docs]
```

## Interactive Decisions

Ask the user when:
- Multiple valid architectural styles could apply
- Tradeoffs require business context (e.g., optimize for speed vs maintainability)
- Breaking changes would be required for improvements
- Scope is unclear (single component vs entire system)
