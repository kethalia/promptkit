# Review Current Changes

Review uncommitted changes against documentation and best practices.

---

## Context

Before reviewing, gather:

1. **Current Changes**
   - Staged changes: `git diff --cached`
   - Unstaged changes: `git diff`
   - All uncommitted: `git diff HEAD`
   - Changed files list: `git status --short`

2. **Repository Documentation**
   - README.md (project overview, conventions)
   - CONTRIBUTING.md (contribution guidelines)
   - Architecture docs (docs/architecture*, ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - API documentation (docs/api*, API.md, OpenAPI specs)
   - AGENTS.md or similar AI/coding guidelines

3. **Related Code Context**
   - Files that import/are imported by changed files
   - Test files for changed modules
   - Type definitions if applicable

## Instructions

1. **Gather Context**
   - Run git diff commands to see all changes
   - Read relevant documentation files
   - Understand the scope and intent of changes

2. **Documentation Consistency Check**
   - Compare changes against relevant docs
   - Identify any conflicts between code and documentation
   - Note undocumented patterns or conventions being used

3. **Best Practices Review**
   - Code organization and structure
   - Naming conventions
   - Error handling
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications
   - Testing coverage
   - DRY principle and code reusability
   - SOLID principles where applicable
   - Accessibility for UI changes

4. **Breaking Change Detection**
   - Public API signature changes
   - Removed or renamed exports
   - Changed default values
   - Modified behavior of existing functions

## Output Format

```
## Documentation Consistency

### Inconsistencies Found
- **[Doc File]** vs `code/path.ts:42`
  - Docs say: [quote]
  - Code does: [description]

## Best Practices Review

### Critical (Must Fix)
- [ ] **[Category]** `file/path.ts:42` - Description
  - Why: Impact explanation
  - Fix: How to resolve

### Important (Should Fix)
- [ ] **[Category]** `file/path.ts:87` - Description
  - Why: Impact explanation
  - Fix: How to resolve

### Minor (Consider)
- [ ] **[Category]** `file/path.ts:123` - Description
  - Suggestion: How to improve

## Summary
- Breaking changes: [list or "None"]
- Technical debt introduced: [list or "None"]
- Overall assessment: [Ready to commit / Needs work]
```

Categories: `Naming`, `Error Handling`, `Security`, `Performance`, `DRY`, `Structure`, `Accessibility`

## Interactive Decisions

1. **For Each Documentation Inconsistency**
   - Ask: "How should this be resolved?"
   - Options: Update code to match docs / Keep code, update docs / Keep as exception

2. **For Each Best Practice Concern**
   - Ask: "Should this be addressed?"
   - Options: Fix now / Keep as-is with justification / Add to tech debt backlog

3. **Before Finishing**
   - Ask: "Ready to proceed? I can help fix issues or prepare a commit."
   - Options: Fix critical issues / Fix all issues / Proceed to commit / Done
