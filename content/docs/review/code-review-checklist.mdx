# Code Review Checklist

Rapid checklist-style review with pass/fail/warning verdicts per category.

---

## Context

Identify the code to review:
- Specific files or directories provided by user
- PR diff via `gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>`
- Staged changes via `git diff --cached`

## Instructions

Run through each checklist category. For each item, assign a verdict:
- **PASS**: No issues found
- **WARN**: Minor concerns or suggestions
- **FAIL**: Issues that should be addressed before merge

### 1. Correctness

- [ ] Logic flow matches intended behavior
- [ ] All code paths return appropriate values
- [ ] Conditionals cover all cases
- [ ] Loops terminate correctly
- [ ] Null/undefined handled properly
- [ ] Type safety maintained (no unsafe casts)
- [ ] Async operations awaited correctly

### 2. Security

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] User input validated and sanitized
- [ ] No SQL/command injection vectors
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checked
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Dependencies don't have known vulnerabilities
- [ ] No exposed internal errors to users

### 3. Performance

- [ ] No unnecessary loops or iterations
- [ ] Database queries are optimized (no N+1)
- [ ] Large data sets paginated or streamed
- [ ] Expensive operations cached when appropriate
- [ ] No memory leaks (event listeners, subscriptions)
- [ ] No blocking operations on main thread

### 4. Maintainability

- [ ] Code is readable without extensive comments
- [ ] Functions are focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] No excessive duplication
- [ ] Naming is clear and consistent
- [ ] Complex logic is documented
- [ ] Dependencies are justified
- [ ] No dead code or unused imports

### 5. Testing

- [ ] New code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Mocks/stubs used appropriately
- [ ] Test names describe behavior
- [ ] Coverage maintained or improved

## Summary
| Category        | Verdict | Issues |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Correctness     | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |
| Security        | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |
| Performance     | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |
| Maintainability | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |
| Testing         | PASS/WARN/FAIL | N |

**Overall: READY / NEEDS WORK / BLOCKED**

## Details

### Correctness: [VERDICT]
- [PASS] Logic flow matches intended behavior
- [WARN] `file.ts:42` - Null check missing, could throw if input undefined
- [FAIL] `file.ts:87` - Infinite loop when array is empty

### Security: [VERDICT]
- [PASS] No hardcoded secrets
- [PASS] Input validated

## Action Items
1. [MUST] Fix: description (`file:line`)
2. [SHOULD] Address: description (`file:line`)
3. [COULD] Consider: description (`file:line`)
```

## Interactive Decisions

1. **After Summary Table**
   - Ask: "Review complete. Want details on any failing category?"
   - Options: Show category details / Show all details / Done

2. **If FAIL Items Exist**
   - Ask: "There are blocking issues. Should I help fix them?"
   - Options: Fix specific item / List all fixes needed / Continue

3. **Before Finishing**
   - Ask: "Generate action items for the PR author?"
   - Options: Yes, generate / No, done
