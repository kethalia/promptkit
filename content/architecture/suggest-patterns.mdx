# Suggest Design Patterns

Recommend applicable design patterns for a given problem or code structure.

---

## Context

Gather before analysis:
- The problem statement or code to improve
- Current implementation approach
- Language and framework in use
- Existing patterns already used in codebase
- Constraints (performance, team familiarity, etc.)

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the problem**
   - What behavior or structure is needed?
   - What changes frequently vs stays stable?
   - What are the extension points?
   - What coupling exists that shouldn't?

2. **Identify candidate patterns**
   - List patterns that address the core problem
   - Consider creational, structural, and behavioral categories
   - Include language-specific idioms (e.g., Go interfaces, React hooks)

3. **Evaluate each pattern**
   - Why does this pattern fit?
   - What problem does it solve here specifically?
   - What are the prerequisites/constraints?
   - How complex is the implementation?

4. **Show implementation approach**
   - Sketch how pattern applies to current code
   - Identify classes/functions to create or modify
   - Note integration points with existing code

5. **Compare alternatives**
   - When would each pattern be preferred?
   - What are the tradeoffs between options?
   - Which is simplest for this case?

6. **Consider framework idioms**
   - Does the framework have built-in solutions?
   - Are there established patterns in this ecosystem?
   - Would a simpler approach suffice?

## Pattern Recommendations for: [Problem Summary]

### Problem Analysis
[What needs to be solved and why current approach is insufficient]

### Recommended Patterns

#### 1. [Pattern Name] (Recommended)
**Category**: Creational/Structural/Behavioral
**Fit**: [Why this pattern matches the problem]

**Implementation sketch**:
```[language]
[Key structural changes or new code]
```

**Pros**: [Benefits in this context]
**Cons**: [Drawbacks or costs]

#### 2. [Alternative Pattern]
**Category**: ...
**Fit**: [Why this could also work]

**Implementation sketch**:
```[language]
[Key structural changes]
```

**Pros**: ...
**Cons**: ...

### Comparison

| Aspect | [Pattern 1] | [Pattern 2] |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Complexity | ... | ... |
| Flexibility | ... | ... |
| Testability | ... | ... |
| Team familiarity | ... | ... |

### Recommendation
[Which pattern to use and why, given the specific context]

### Framework Considerations
[Relevant built-in solutions or ecosystem patterns]
```

## Interactive Decisions

Ask the user when:
- Problem scope is ambiguous (local fix vs systemic change)
- Multiple patterns are equally valid
- Team experience with patterns is unknown
- Performance constraints might affect choice
- Existing codebase conventions conflict with pattern
