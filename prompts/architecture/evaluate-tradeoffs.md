# Evaluate Tradeoffs

Compare multiple approaches with structured pros/cons analysis and recommendation.

---

## Context

Gather before analysis:
- All proposed approaches to compare
- Problem being solved
- Constraints (time, resources, performance requirements)
- Current system state and dependencies
- Team capabilities and preferences
- Long-term roadmap if relevant

## Instructions

1. **Clarify the approaches**
   - Ensure each approach is well-defined
   - Identify assumptions in each
   - Note any hybrid possibilities

2. **Define evaluation criteria**
   - Complexity (implementation and ongoing)
   - Performance (runtime, memory, latency)
   - Maintainability (readability, debuggability)
   - Testability (unit, integration, mocking)
   - Scalability (load, data volume, team size)
   - Risk (unknowns, failure modes)
   - Cost (development time, infrastructure)

3. **Analyze each approach**
   - Score against each criterion
   - Identify hidden costs (migration, training, tooling)
   - Identify hidden benefits (reusability, optionality)
   - Note dependencies and prerequisites

4. **Build comparison matrix**
   - Side-by-side scoring
   - Highlight decisive differences
   - Note where approaches are equivalent

5. **Identify edge cases**
   - When would each approach fail?
   - What changes would invalidate each choice?
   - Reversibility of each decision

6. **Formulate recommendation**
   - Weight criteria by importance
   - Account for uncertainty
   - Provide clear reasoning

**Cons**:
- [Cost with explanation]

**Hidden factors**:
- [Non-obvious costs or benefits]

**Failure modes**:
- [When this approach breaks down]

[Repeat for each approach]

### Comparison Matrix

| Criterion | Approach A | Approach B | Approach C |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|
| Complexity | [Low/Med/High] | ... | ... |
| Performance | ... | ... | ... |
| Maintainability | ... | ... | ... |
| Testability | ... | ... | ... |
| Scalability | ... | ... | ... |
| Risk | ... | ... | ... |
| **Weighted Score** | [X/50] | [X/50] | [X/50] |

### Decision Factors

**Choose Approach A if**: [conditions]
**Choose Approach B if**: [conditions]
**Choose Approach C if**: [conditions]

### Recommendation
**[Recommended Approach]**

[Reasoning based on weighted criteria and context]

### Reversibility
[How hard is it to change course later for each approach]
```

## Interactive Decisions

Ask the user when:
- Priority weights are needed for criteria
- Business context affects the decision
- Risk tolerance is unclear
- Timeline constraints change the calculus
- Approaches are too close to call objectively
- Missing information would change the analysis

**Prompt for weights**:
> "How would you prioritize these criteria (1-5)?
> - Complexity (implementation effort)
> - Performance (speed, efficiency)
> - Maintainability (long-term clarity)
> - Testability (verification ease)
> - Scalability (growth handling)
> - Risk (unknowns, failure potential)"
